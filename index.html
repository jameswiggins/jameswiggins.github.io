        Hi! I just graduated (May 18) from Georgia Tech with a BS in Industrial Engineering. This summer I interned at Delta Air Lines in Atlanta before starting Georgia Tech's yearlong MS Data Analytics program. I like making informed/data-driven decisions, and I like helping others do the same. I also enjoy working on startups and I'm always seeking opportunities to gain experience with data science.
