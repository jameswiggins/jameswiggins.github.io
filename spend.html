        There are several nuances about my credit card app which make it exceedingly difficult to answer a very simple question: 
        how much money do I have left this month??  
    </p>
    <p>
        Things like an abnormal billing cycle (mine ends exactly 25 days before my due date which is always the 7th), 
        the lag between using my credit card and the expense showing up as a transaction (pending transactions), 
        the balance left over from last month still showing up in the total balance in my app, ...etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The dashboard above is designed to be viewed on my cell phone. 
        It utilizes free tools (google forms, sheets, and data studio) and enables me to quickly answer 
        my simple and recurring question.
        Every time I use my credit card I fill out a google form that has two fields: description and amount.
        The timestamp is automatically captured by the submittion and the results of the form are sent to a google sheet. 
        The google studio dashboard points to that sheet and automatically refreshes whenever there is a new entry. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am very proud of this simple but useful dashboard and I have gotten a lot of use out of it since I made it!
        It was pretty straight forward to set up...
        If you are working on configuring something similar for yourself, feel free to reach out. 
        Would love to get your thoughts on this or even collaborate on a better solution :)
